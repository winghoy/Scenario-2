# Scenario 2

Python app built using the **Kivy** Framework. The app allows the user to input their own *symptoms* and see a list of past *symptoms*, as well as their *vital signs* sent from wearables. 

Symptoms are saved onto a `patient.txt` file in the same directory. The existing file contains test data.

## Installation 

Use the following terminal command to install the Kivy Framework:
```  
pip install kivy
```
